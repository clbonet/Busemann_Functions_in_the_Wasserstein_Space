This folder contains the experiments with the Gaussian mixtures sliced distances.

- Figure 11 and 12 can be reproduced in `ClusterDetection.ipynb`.
- Figure 13 can be reproduced in `Flows_GMMs.ipynb`.

The code of some of the distance, and of the experiment of cluster detection is inspired from https://github.com/MoePien/sliced_OT_for_GMMs. The code for the flow over Gaussian mixtures is taken from an example of [POT](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/gaussian_gmm/plot_GMM_flow.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-gaussian-gmm-plot-gmm-flow-py).
